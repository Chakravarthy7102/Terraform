###TERRAFORM INIT###
1.this command intitalizes the terraform and downloads the "nessasary plugins related to the provisers in the .tf file".
$ terraform init

###TERRAFORM PLAN###
2.It runs a dry run on your code and show changes required by the current configuration
The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. By default, when Terraform creates a plan it:

Reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date.
Compares the current configuration to the prior state and noting any differences.
Proposes a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration.
$ terraform plan

###TERRAFORM STATE###
3.The terraform state command is used for advanced state management. As your Terraform usage becomes more advanced,
  there are some cases where you may need to modify the Terraform state. 
  Rather than modify the state directly, the terraform state commands can be used in many cases instead.

$ terraform state <sub-command> <[options] [args]>
Examples:
 $ terraform state show <name>
  this command will list out the all the related stuff about the paticular resource.
  ex: terraform state list prod_vpc
#Terraform state list

$ terraform state list 
 this command will list out the all the resources created by this terraform project.


###TERRAFORM OUTPUT####
4.The terraform output command is used to extract the value of an output variable from the state file.
 $ terraform output [options] [NAME]

 Examples : https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/output
  - insted of doing terraform apply to see the newly added output we can also use command
   $ terraform refresh

###TERRAFORM DESTROY###
5.the terraform destroy command will detsroy the all the allocated resources if dont specify a resource explicitly
 $ terraform destroy
 else to destroy a resource indivisually use
 $ terraform destroy -target <resorce-name>

 ###TERRAORM APPLY###
 6.terraform apply will apply the changes on to the actual infrastructure
  $ terraform apply
  -the above command will apply all the changes are done to the .tf file
  $ terraform apply -target <resource-name>
  -the above command only will apply changes realtef to the that resource-name
  $ terraform apply -var "<var-name>=<value>"
